## üíÅ What is an LLM-VM? üíÅ

LLM-VM is a full-stack inference engine for large language models, or chatbot backend. By optimizing for personal development, we designed an opinionated backend for running LLMs with all the modern features we enjoy from completion including tool usage, persistent stateful memory, live data augmentation, data and task fine-tuning, output templating, and more.

LLM-VM puts the power of AI into your hands by offering a meaningful abstraction layer between you and your models, optimizing for your hardware automatically. AI should help solve problems for development teams, not create them. LLM-VM's abstraction offers a scalable way to get started with AI development and deployment.


## ü§å Why Anarchy? ü§å 

AGI is at risk of being captured by whoever can afford to chase it. Developing AGI is costly and time-consuming. The LLM-VM aims to democratize AGI by attacking the barriers to entry at the root, opening the gates to this transformative technology.

Working with local models can save you time and money by giving you the flexibility to choose the best LLM for your needs, and limiting your exposure to pay-as-you-go services, all with the support and transparency of an active open source community!

    Anarchy is law and freedom without force.

    We don't put you in the driver seat and tell you where to drive.
    
    If you want it, we want you to have it.

    Just don't use our hosted playground for anything illegal.
