    Running your models on your hardware is key to democratizing AGI.  We might be able to make it faster on ours, 
    but every optimiztion made effects how these models behave and thus one's ability to hack them.  
    We'll always keep this core open.

    You shouldn't have to be an AI PhD to set up your own chatbot.  
    Our inference engine is both highly optimized to run models and includes all the bells-and-whistles of OpenAI (agentic tool use, large context windows), 
    and more: persistent state, web playground, api endpoints, fine-tuning, teacher-student distillation, vector storage.

    We DGAF what you use our OSS AI for.  We get very annoyed when the bots tell us they are just bots.
    If you want that, we don't mind.
