## Contributing

Contributing is easy.  First and most importantly, [hop on our discord](https://discord.gg/qaFf7S373c) and introduce yourself.

Our aim is for this community to be not just for organization, but a teaching community.  
Don't be afraid to speak up with questions, and don't shame people for asking them!
There is a mix of experts and n00bs there.

## Bounty

Some tickets we'll pay you for closing! Look at the [ticket](https://github.com/anarchy-ai/LLM-VM/issues) labels to see how much the bounty is. 
Note we can't guarantee that if you close a ticket we can pay you (only if you are from a non-US sanctioned country), and it is up to you to reach out and provide bank details.

## Swag

If a ticket has the SWAG tag, you'll get a discount code for up to $50 of free swag from our [swag-shop](https://swag.anarchy.ai/)
