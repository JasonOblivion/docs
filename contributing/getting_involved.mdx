This project is at it's very earliest stages, but we still welcome support!
We have a number of ways to get involved, from [working for us](jobs), to working on [tickets directly](community_development).

By far the easiest way to get a job is to work on tickets directly and become a top contributor and get noticed!

As we want to encourage open-source AGI development, we have a bounty program to pay for open development
