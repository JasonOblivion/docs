## The REBEL Agent
**REcursion Based Extensible LLM**

Our REBEL agent takes a novel approach to answering complex questions. Est recursive reasoning, REBEL expands what LLMs can do with problem decomposition and tool use. In this way, we are able to answer questions requiring data LLMs were not directly trained on.

### Running REBEL
**Getting started with REBEL is easy**
```python quickstart_REBEL.py
# import our client
from llm_vm.client import Client
import os

# Instantiate the client specifying which LLM you want to use
client = Client(big_model='chat_gpt', small_model='gpt') #REBEL will use chat_gpt no matter what big model is specified here, this specification exists for non-REBEL completion calls. 

#Calling client.complete with a tool list specified leads to the REBEL agent being used.
response = client.complete(
	 prompt = 'Is it warmer in Paris or Timbuktu and what are the temperatures in either city?',
         context='',
         openai_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"), #for REBEL we need an OpenAI key
         tools=[{'description': 'Find the weather at a location and returns it in celcius.',  #this tool list contains only one dictionary, therefore only one tool
                 'dynamic_params': {
		 		   "latitude": 'latitude of as a float',
		 		   "longitude": 'the longitude as a float'
				   },
                 'method': 'GET',
                 'url': "https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast",
                 'static_params': {'current_weather': 'true'}}]) #No tools by default, so you have to add your own
print(response)
```
### Tool Definition
Tools are defined by dictionaries in that are added to the tool list. These dictionaries need to contain the following fields:

**description**: the description of what the tool does


As many tools as desired can be added to the tool list, and REBEL will attempt to compositionally answer a question that may require calling multiple tools.
