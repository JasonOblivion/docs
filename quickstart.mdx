## Installation
**Use git and pip to quickly install the LLM-VM**

Navigate to your desired directory and run the following

```bash installing anarchy
> git clone https://github.com/anarchy-ai/LLM-VM.git
> cd LLM-VM
> pip3 install .
```
This will install both the library and test-sever


## Generating Competions
** Generate from prompts in 3 lines **

```python quickstart.py
# import our client
from llm_vm.client import Client

# Select which LLM you want to use, here we have openAI's 
client = Client(big_model = 'chat_gpt')

# Put in your prompt and go!
response = client.complete(prompt = 'What is Anarchy?', context = '', openai_key = 'ENTER_YOUR_API_KEY')
print(response)
# Anarchy is a political ideology that advocates for the absence of government...
```
Our Client allows you to interact with OpenAI's completion endpoint seemlessly.


## Locally Run an LLM
**Choose a popular LLM and use it as easily as chat-gpt**
```python quickstart.py
# import our client
from llm_vm.client import Client
import os

# Instantiate the client specifying which LLM you want to use

client = Client(big_model='pythia')

# Put in your prompt and go!
response = client.complete(prompt = 'What is anarchy?',
                           context='')
print(response)
# Anarchy is a political system in which the state is abolished and the people are free...
```

## Supported Models
** Easily select from a selection of popular LLMs **
```python Supported Models
Supported_Models = ['chat_gpt','gpt','neo','llama','bloom','opt','pythia']
```

## Picking a Different Model
**Need a bigger or smaller version of a supported model?**

With LLM-VM this is no problem!
```python quickstart.py
# import our client
from llm_vm.client import Client

# After selecting the supported model, specify a hugging face endpoint.
client = Client(big_model = 'neo',
       	 	big_model_config={'model_uri':'EleutherAI/gpt-neox-20b'}, 
                small_model ='neo',
		small_model_config={'model_uri':'EleutherAI/gpt-neox-125m'})

# Put in your prompt and go!
response = client.complete(prompt = 'What is Anarchy?', context = '')
print(response)
# Anarchy is a political philosophy that advocates no government...
```
