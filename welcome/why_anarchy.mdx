title: 'ðŸ¤” Why Anarchy?'
description: "We're on a mission to democratize AI at whatever the cost. We're hackers who've grown tired of AI safety rhetoric meaning locked-down APIs with inconsistent support."

Anarchy was born out of exaspiration.  We'd been AI safety researchers, hackers and long-time GNU beneficiaries,  
who saw the gestalt of our domains being annexed by the fascist rhetoric of so-called "doomers" afraid 
of "long-termist" sci-fi hypotheticals.  To us, the encroachment of regulations on our self-expression 
was a far more dire threat.  We decided then to eschew such viewpoints and do what such extremists would consider 
most anarchic: give AI access to the world.
