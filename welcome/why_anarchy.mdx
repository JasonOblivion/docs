## Bounty
Some tickets we'll pay you for closing! Look at the ticket labels to see how much the bounty is. Note we can't guarantee that if you close a ticket we can pay you (only if you are from a non-US sanctioned country), and it is up to you to reach out and provide bank details.

## Our promises
**1. We will move towards open-source, not away from it.**

**2. We will work to accelerate the commoditization of AI.**

**3. We will not judge your use-cases.** (provided it is legal)

## ðŸ’¸ How will we make money? ðŸ’¸

We are working to provide managed model hosting and training infrastructure for both developers and enterprises.
