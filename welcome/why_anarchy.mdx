title: 'ðŸ¤Œ Why Anarchy?'
description: "We're on a mission to democratize AGI at whatever the cost. We're hackers who've grown tired of AI safety rhetoric meaning locked-down APIs with inconsistent support."

## Why use our LLM-VM?

- **Own Your Models** - You shouldn't have to worry about whether an API will suddenly go down or whether you'll be banned.

- **Own Your Data** - Likewise, you can't always trust a third party with sensitive data.

- **Efficiency** - You can tweak your models to fit your cost and efficiency needs.

- **Community** - Join our active community of highly motivated developers and engineers working passionately to democratize AGI.

- **Open Development** - Nothing is hidden.  You noticed a bug?  You can fix it now!  Afraid we're misusing your data?  Check for yourself.

## Our promises

- **We will move towards open-source, not away from it.**

- **We will work to accelerate the commoditization of AI.**

- **We will not judge your use-cases (provided it is legal).**


## How will we make money?

We're believers in the buyer-based open-core business model. 
Specifically, we're working to provide managed model hosting and training infrastructure for both developers and enterprises.
